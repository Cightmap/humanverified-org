<h2 id="thecurrentstateofairegulationintheus">The Current State of AI Regulation in the US</h2>

<p>Right now, the US tackles AI rules with a mix of existing laws, new proposals, and guidelines. Think of the efforts of several governmental bodies and states trying things. All of this adds up to a national approach to artificial intelligence regulation.</p>

<p>The government is working, bit by bit, to get it right. There are no comprehensive federal laws yet that directly manage the growth or use of AI models.</p>

<p>Several bills in Congress are being discussed that cover subjects ranging from AI education and how it plays into copyright laws, to robocalls and the technology&rsquo;s place in national security.<sup>1</sup> Some proposals go so far as preventing AI from deploying weapons without any human participation.<sup>1</sup></p>

<h3 id="federaloversightandguidance">Federal Oversight and Guidance</h3>

<p>Various government arms are issuing orders and guidelines. The White House laid out a broad Executive Order on AI last year.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p>These federal guidelines press for clear standards and testing. It impacts developers of large AI models. It&#39;s possible this could be repealed in a new term.</p>

<p>Federal agencies like the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov" target="_blank">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) are getting active. The FTC warned against using AI tools in ways that lead to bias, stressing fairness in trade.<sup>10</sup></p>

<p>They joined with other agencies, like the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov" target="_blank">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC), on a statement to apply current rules to AI. This aims to prevent unfair results.<sup>9</sup> They&#39;ve gone further, acting against false <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-announces-crackdown-deceptive-ai-claims-schemes" target="_blank">AI claims</a> and ordering firms like Rite Aid to stop using <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/12/rite-aid-banned-using-ai-facial-recognition-after-ftc-says-retailer-deployed-technology-without" target="_blank">facial recognition</a> improperly.<sup>12</sup></p>

<h3 id="statelevelactions">State-Level Actions</h3>

<p>States aren&#39;t waiting on the federal government. They&#39;re crafting their own rules. Virginia is looking to manage how <strong>high-risk AI systems</strong> are used when decisions affecting consumers are made.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>This includes a law that focuses on preventing damage from high-risk AI. It targets decisions on work, education, and health.</p>

<p>This effort brings in standards like those from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and aligns it with a worldwide view found in places like the EU. The state shows that states and countries think similarly about <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/tag/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">artificial intelligence</a>.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>In 2024, a law went into force banning robocalls using AI voices.<sup>8</sup></p>

<p>The law builds on one made back in the &#39;90s. It shows an early move to curb abuses with tech.</p>

<p>In July of 2019, <em>The Bolstering Online Transparency Act</em> came about. This makes using bots to affect online interaction or sales without saying so illegal in California.</p>

<h3 id="landmarkbills">Landmark Bills</h3>

<p>There are a bunch of critical pieces of legislation to watch, such as the National AI Initiative Act of 2020.<sup>4</sup> This act pushed for better AI study and the setting up of the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office to head U.S. AI strategies.</p>

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act deals with AI in aviation.<sup>2</sup> It shows growing attention to domain-specific AI impacts.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a stress on working together for a safe AI world as well. Important figures in tech, like CEOs of OpenAI and Google, back forming bodies and agreements for managing AI&#39;s use and expansion globally.</p>

<h2 id="challengesandfuturetrendsinairegulation">Challenges and Future Trends in AI Regulation</h2>

<p>Laws and acts provide direction, but they come with big hurdles. Finding laws that keep up with fast-paced AI innovation presents difficulty.</p>

<p>The rules made need to balance pushing for new ideas and stopping harm. A fragmented strategy, mixing many levels of rule-making, adds to business costs and can lower the US&#39;s edge.</p>

<h3 id="needforclarity">Need for Clarity</h3>

<p>A major difficulty is the lack of clarity.<sup>45</sup> There needs to be an accepted way of categorizing risk AI.</p>

<p>Laws are different and not clear. They don&rsquo;t lay out duties that businesses and users must act on.</p>

<p>More voices add to this. Leaders have to speak for the whole on clear paths.</p>

<h3 id="ethicalandpracticalconcerns">Ethical and Practical Concerns</h3>

<p>Many big players see it&rsquo;s crucial to act wisely and ethically. Even tech heads point to an existential risk.</p>

<p>Sam Altman of OpenAI told senators of the importance of licensing big AI works, adding safety checks. Tech firms like Google also want pacts showing self-governance and working with those creating laws.</p>

<p>Yet, rules on data privacy mean some services, for instance, Google&#39;s Bard, stay out of big areas.</p>

<h3 id="proposedlegislativeefforts">Proposed Legislative Efforts</h3>

<p>Many are trying to bring in a federal-level structure with proposals. It could form a detailed rule for overseeing AI in business and personal use.</p>

<p>Such moves mark a want in law and community. These seek a future with protection from downsides, along with innovation&#39;s power.</p>

<p>The trend for watching AI regulatory actions is pointing up. This suggests laws must act quickly, so you should not be out of step.</p>

<p>Doing it makes following shifts simpler. It helps avoid problems and catching new chances.</p>

<h2 id="sectorspecificaigovernance">Sector-Specific AI Governance</h2>

<p>Besides broad actions, certain fields use custom AI guidelines. Such acts handle certain challenges seen in special industries. Each case offers clues on complete paths for watching over artificial intelligence, promising responsible spread across vital areas of living and commerce.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h3>

<p>The health care domain has specific issues like privacy with automated choices for care. The sector deals with HIPAA guidelines already.</p>

<p>AI is already enhancing medical diagnoses, for example, improving accuracy in detecting breast cancer.<sup>46</sup> This progress offers an idea for similar rules in managing new medical technology.</p>

<h3 id="finance">Finance</h3>

<p>AI in finance goes from risk management to detecting lies. It includes many hard oversight tasks.</p>

<p>Entities must check biases to stick with banking laws. A need exists for ways that catch unfairness from these smart tools.</p>

<h3 id="consumersafety">Consumer Safety</h3>

<p>The way customers know goods meets rules needs guarding with AI entering selling. Laws want open communication with all tech aids so consumers have the power.</p>

<p>These stress true data and freedom from hiding tech&rsquo;s place.</p>

<h2 id="impactofinternationalframeworksonusaipolicy">Impact of International Frameworks on U.S. AI Policy</h2>

<p>When talking about artificial intelligence, it&#39;s critical to see how laws and talks worldwide impact the US method. This covers pacts such as the European Union&#39;s act, helping form how rules are created around the world.</p>

<p>It shows different methods on making policy that handles risk and boosts good behavior. The moves in places like the EU and groups such as the G7 play a role in driving the dialogue and plans inside the US.</p>

<p>Following actions abroad guides America in crafting effective AI rules. The wide action plan for controlling AI is becoming a fact for global business. Being ready lets groups meet varying compliance requirements.</p>

<p>Being alert on global trends has major value. Organizations keeping a handle on rules cut dangers, take chances, and keep good use practices across all settings.</p>
