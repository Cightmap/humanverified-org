<h2 id="understandingprivilegedidentitymanagement">Understanding Privileged Identity Management </h2>

<p><strong>Privileged identity management </strong>is a strategy for controlling, overseeing, and auditing the elevated access rights granted to specific users or accounts within an organization. PIM aims to provide authorized individuals with time-bound access to sensitive resources, only when they&#39;re completely needed. </p>

<p>These privileged accounts, held by system administrators, database managers, or even service accounts, hold immense power. Think of network configuration abilities and full cloud storage settings that may or may not have protections in place. </p>

<p>Because these accounts have greater ability, securing and properly managing privileged accounts is necessary for reducing security risks. Attackers exploit emerging industry vulnerabilities very quickly. With proper <strong>privileged ID management, </strong>risk can be reduced. </p>

<h3 id="themechanicsofpimsolutions">The Mechanics of PIM Solutions </h3>

<p>PIM doesn&#39;t just blindly grant access. It is set up to verify someone&#39;s identity. </p>

<p>This can add different levels of security steps, to allow or prevent further access. <strong>Privileged identity access management </strong>helps prevent attacks. </p>

<p>Privileged Identity Management solutions work by enforcing the concept of least privilege. That concept, when put into practice, gives people only enough system-level capabilities to accomplish what is requested or needed of them. Here&#39;s a general way a system might look: </p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Role Assignment: </strong>Roles are created with particular permission sets. Authorized individuals are granted to use this role. </li>
	<li><strong>User Asks for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-how-to-activate-role" target="_blank">Role Activation </a>:</strong>People who can gain higher-level roles will have to send a request. Then that request includes how long, and what someone intends to do. </li>
	<li>Then approvals occur from someone who reviews access rights. Privileged role administrator will review those requests. </li>
	<li><strong>Approvals Granted: </strong>Access to resources using higher-level permissions requires some setup ahead of time, before someone can fully get into things at the requested levels. Access can have certain automated conditions or an assigned individual. This creates time-bound access. </li>
	<li><strong>Access Monitoring: </strong>Audit logs keep a record. This gives insight into security for any privileged account changes or strange activity that might take place. </li>
</ol>

<p>The right to make alterations on a network comes with a significant amount of power. But someone in sales would normally only gain permission to areas that they actually use. </p>

<p>Someone who modifies a setting or changes access would be someone like a system administrator or similar security manager. A global administrator has very high level rights, so they have added risk. </p>

<h2 id="keyfeaturesofpim">Key Features of PIM </h2>

<p>Robust <strong>privileged identity management (PIM) </strong>systems offer a consolidated approach to managing and securing elevated access rights, protecting critical systems and resources. A good PIM solution has a strong feature set, enhanced by integration with <strong>enterprise password management </strong> and <strong>Secure Access Modules (SAMs) </strong>.</p>

<p>PIM tools come with core elements to safeguard assets by addressing multiple factors. These key features define a comprehensive <strong>privileged identity management system </strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Centralized Management: </strong>A unified platform where administrators can oversee privileged accounts and their provisioning across the organization. </li>
	<li><strong>Role-Based Access Control: </strong><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/be-en/2017/07/18/one-user-name-rule-cloud-identity-management-one-stop-saas-shop" target="_blank">Identity management </a>assigns privileged roles to match individuals with permissions needed for specific tasks or scopes. </li>
	<li><strong>Just-in-Time (JIT) Access: </strong>Temporary elevation of privileges ensures users don&rsquo;t retain permanent control, such as time-bound access to Azure resources. </li>
	<li><strong>Auditing and Reporting: </strong>Detailed logs of system changes, role assignments, and access approvals enhance visibility for security teams. </li>
	<li><strong>Enterprise Password Management Integration: </strong>Pairing PIM with password solutions generates and rotates credentials securely, often using one-time passwords for privileged access. </li>
	<li><strong>Secure Access Module Support: </strong>SAMs add hardware-based security, authenticating privileged identities via smartcards or cryptographic chips. </li>
</ul>

<p>Incorporating multifactor authentication further strengthens PIM, ensuring robust access management. </p>

<h2 id="whyisprivilegedidentitymanagementcritical">Why Is Privileged Identity Management Critical? </h2>

<p>If privileged accounts are breached, the outcomes can be substantial. The organization can lose consumer confidence. </p>

<p>Additionally, threats from insiders, whether intentional or otherwise, also have capabilities. Some access levels enable people to cause disruptions within a business&#39;s ecosystem. </p>

<p>Stolen credentials are the blame in nearly 60% of security events in firms. Privileged access that is not managed, adds major risk to those firms.</p>

<h2 id="enhancingpimwithenterprisepasswordmanagementandsecureaccessmodulessams">Enhancing PIM with Enterprise Password Management and Secure Access Modules (SAMs) </h2>

<p>Privileged identity management doesn&rsquo;t operate in isolation&mdash;it thrives when paired with complementary technologies like enterprise password management and Secure Access Modules (SAMs). Together, they form a defense-in-depth strategy to secure critical systems. </p>

<p>Enterprise password management focuses on generating, storing, and rotating credentials securely across an organization, especially for privileged accounts. It ensures passwords are complex, unique, and managed through a centralized system, often providing one-time passwords for temporary access. Meanwhile, a Secure Access Module (SAM)&mdash;typically a tamper-resistant smartcard or chip&mdash;stores cryptographic keys that never leave the device, performing authentication or encryption tasks to secure access. </p>

<p>Use Case: Imagine an IT admin accessing a server. PIM grants temporary privileges via just-in-time access, enterprise password management provides a one-time password, and a SAM-enabled smartcard ensures the login is authenticated securely, preventing key theft or session hijacking. Here, PIM governs access control, password management secures credentials, and SAMs protect the cryptographic backbone. </p>

<p>This integration reduces the attack surface by combining identity governance, credential protection, and hardware-enforced security&mdash;vital for organizations managing privileged roles and sensitive data. </p>

<h2 id="pimpamandiamunderstandingthedifferences">PIM, PAM, and IAM: Understanding the Differences </h2>

<p>It&#39;s easy to get lost in the alphabet soup of access management, with acronyms like PAM, PIM, and IAM. So here&#39;s some understanding, because the topics relate to the concept of who can do what and on what systems or in which areas of access. </p>

<p>While Identity Access Management (IAM) establishes the larger setting, Privileged Access Management (PAM) centers on granting temporary use to an account. The approach here is for security since those people granted more control have that control when requested. </p>

<p>PIM tools give insights. You will gain discovery of privileged identities that are used or have not been logged into for longer time spans. PIM specifically watches those accounts and how and when those privileges might change. </p>

<h2 id="implementingpimforrobustsecurity">Implementing PIM for Robust Security </h2>

<p>Incorporating a Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management solution into your defense is about minimizing risk. So this takes a well-thought-out strategy. </p>

<ul>
	<li>Start by mapping out all of the <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/privileged-identity-management" target="_blank">privileged accounts </a>within your infrastructure, across systems, resources, and areas. </li>
	<li>Create a centralized platform to protect sensitive account credentials, including passwords and SSH keys. </li>
</ul>

<p>Having settings available to review activities around privileged accounts can spot warning signs. Requiring approval before activating an eligible role can add safety. </p>

<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure" target="_blank">Microsoft Entra roles </a>make it easier for larger and smaller teams to collaborate by giving certain areas for control without making all members all-powerful. Think of more levels for people to manage particular segments of systems and resources. </p>

<h3 id="integratingpimwithexistingsystems">Integrating PIM with Existing Systems </h3>

<p>To have a good effect, PIM tools often need to be part of your environment. Integration with existing directories is key. </p>

<p>This connection improves the system and simplifies finding or addressing potential security holes. Role assignments will flow easier with this in place. </p>

<h3 id="thebenefitsofusingaprivilegedidentitymanagementsystem">The Benefits of Using a Privileged Identity Management System </h3>

<p>With PIM correctly configured and set, several areas see improvement for firms. First, risks are cut down significantly as the controls gain finer tuning around all activity. The reduced attack surface helps. </p>

<p>Second, insight also surfaces previously unknown things, adding additional visibility into processes. Next, any rules or business governance procedures are easier to keep intact. Below shows some details: </p>

<table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
