<h2 id="thecoreofzerotrust">The Core of Zero Trust</h2>

<p>Zero trust operates on a simple principle, do not trust anyone or anything by default, verify first. It does not matter if it is an inside or an outside connection, all entities are treated with suspicion.</p>

<p>This <strong>security model</strong> shifts from older methods that treated the &quot;trust, but verify&quot; method as safe. Every access request is fully looked at, checked for identity, authorized, and encrypted before access is granted.</p>

<h2 id="zerotrustsecuritystrategypillars">Zero Trust Security Strategy Pillars</h2>

<p>Traditional security methods often fail. The cost per data breach has gone up to $3.92 Million and so the adoption of zero trust has increased.</p>

<p>Several core principles form the bedrock of zero trust:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Continuous Verification:</strong> Continuous monitoring means there are no trusted areas, usernames, or devices. Continuous evaluation incorporates various elements to provide a comprehensive view of the system. This vigilance is necessary for maintaining a secure environment.</li>
	<li><strong>Limiting Potential Issues:</strong> If a security problem happens, containment is key. Limiting scope keeps problems as small as possible, reducing potential damage.</li>
	<li><strong>Automated Tracking:</strong> Automated tracking monitors Users, Devices, Systems, Apps, Networks, and Data. It also establishes rules for automatically responding to problems. This automation enables rapid responses to threats.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementingazerotrustsecuritystrategy">Implementing a Zero Trust Security Strategy</h2>

<p>The US government gave direction for federal agencies to move to zero trust in support of this. <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf" target="_blank">Memorandum 22-09</a> was created as that method.</p>

<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/standards/memo-22-09-meet-identity-requirements" target="_blank">Microsoft has some options</a> for agencies to meet zero trust guidance in memorandum 22-09. They provide support to transition to this framework.</p>

<h3 id="buildingzerotrustwiththerighttools">Building Zero Trust with the Right Tools</h3>

<p>You do not have to face zero trust alone. <strong>Multifactor authentication</strong> is a common element to protect accounts.</p>

<p>Microsoft Defender and <strong>Microsoft Entra</strong> are two examples of security offerings. Businesses can adopt them for improved security strategies. Many options exist though, like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/zero-trust?lnk=flatitem" target="_blank">zero trust solutions from IBM</a>.</p>

<h3 id="stepsforzerotrust">Steps for Zero Trust</h3>

<p>The change to a zero trust strategy involves several key adjustments to your technology:</p>

<ol>
	<li>First, get a clear idea of the assets in your infrastructure. Identifying your assets allows you to better categorize risk and value.</li>
	<li>Then, give different levels of <strong>least-privilege access</strong>, depending on roles and situations. Access changes based on these various reasons. This method limits access and contains problems easier.</li>
	<li><strong>Data protection</strong> is crucial and encrypting data helps. This needs to happen both at rest and in transit. If this doesn&#39;t happen, data will be at risk.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="thehumanelement">The Human Element</h2>

<p>Did you know internal users cause 34% of data breaches? Human factors such as dissatisfied workers, employee mistakes, and former staff can expose companies to risk.</p>

<p>No system is perfect. Internal user education is needed for <strong>data security</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="extendingsecurity">Extending Security</h2>

<p>One method companies use is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-sentinel" target="_blank">Microsoft Sentinel</a>. This improves cloud-native protection. It also combines this with a security incident event manager for managing log activity.</p>

<p>Tools like Azure support zero trust principles for infrastructure, apps, and cloud support like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ddos-protection" target="_blank">Azure DDoS Protection</a>. Good <strong>access controls</strong> on devices is critical to a good security infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="adaptingtochanges">Adapting To Changes</h2>

<p>Zero trust takes continuous attention. The threats change all the time, requiring regular updates and <strong>risk assessment</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="adaptingtherightstrategy">Adapting the Right Strategy</h3>

<p>There is more than one way to apply Zero Trust, and knowing what <strong>trust model</strong> fits best can improve an enterprise quickly if <a href="https://clickup.com/templates/roadmap/for-cybersecurity-strategy" target="_blank">security strategy</a> measures are properly setup. Protections that reduce impact with automated checks are a good idea for a business.</p>

<h2 id="faqsaboutzerotrustsecuritystrategy">FAQs about zero trust security strategy</h2>

<h3 id="whatisthezerotrustsecurityapproach">What is the zero trust security approach?</h3>

<p>Zero trust is a security method requiring all entities, both inside and outside a network, to be identified, validated, and monitored. This method limits <strong>implicit trust</strong>. It contrasts older strategies that trusted anything inside the firewall.</p>

<h3 id="whatarethe5pillarsofzerotrust">What are the 5 pillars of zero trust?</h3>

<p>The term &quot;pillars&quot; varies in zero trust discussions. Most methods, however, emphasize visibility, automation, <strong>network segmentation</strong>, continuous validation, and limited <strong>network access</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="whatsthedifferencebetweenvpnandztna">What&#39;s the difference between VPN and ZTNA?</h3>

<p>VPN (Virtual Private Network) tools provide broad, basic network <strong>remote access</strong>. In contrast, ZTNA (<strong>Zero Trust Network Access</strong>) offers granular access based on identity. <strong>Secure access</strong> will take place with the use of these.</p>

<h3 id="whatarethe5basiccontrolplanesofzerotrust">What are the 5 basic control planes of zero trust?</h3>

<p>Companies vary on this also. Typically identity, device, network, workload and <strong>data protect</strong> methods would be controlled.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Shifting to a zero trust security strategy might seem complex. The issues keep increasing. More parts of organizations now use new tools and methods because of <strong>digital transformation</strong>.</p>

<p>The threats aren&#39;t going away anytime soon. A zero trust security strategy will position networks to deal with problems much easier.</p>
